__Brief:__

Use this script to setup a complete local running Nightscout instance on a RasPi 3B or better, running Ubuntu Bionic.
This script can either install:
- a local MongoDB instance (recommended!) or
- work without MongoDB and use static OpenAPS report files (recommended for tiny rigs) 

__Tested with:__

- Raspberry Pi 3B+ (rpi3b+): FIXME Everything works nicely with or without PIXEL (Release date: 2016-09-23 and 2016-11-25)

__Prerequisites:__

 -1. A RasPi 4(B) must be updated with the latest (Raspbian-provided) firmware, see
	https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-firmware-updating-recovery-guide/

 0. Install Raspberry Pi SD card with Debian Ubuntu "Bionic", ready for RasPi 4B from
	https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-4-ubuntu-server-desktop-18-04-3-image-unofficial/

   At the time of this writing, Version 18.04.4 was provided.
   This comes as a server-only image; addition of desktop is possible, see James's instructions.

   Username: ubuntu Password: ubuntu

 1. Configure your Raspberry Pi
   `$ sudo raspi-config`
    ```
    1. Expand Filesystem   ==> Make use of the whole SD card
    2. Change User Password
    3. Bootoptions ==> Choose what you want
    4. Wait for Network at Boot ==> Set to No
    5. Internationalisation Options => Change Locale, Timezone, Keyboard Layout, Wi-Fi country to your needs
    7. Advanced Options
	A2. Hostname ==> Set your hostname. This will be used for the URL of your Nightscout
	A4. SSH ==> Enable SSH for remote access
    ```
   then reboot

2. Make sure your system is up to date:
   `$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y`


3. Tweak your Raspberry Pi.
See for example: https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-0/rpi.html for information on setting up your Raspberry Pi:
- Configure WiFi Settings
- Wifi reliability tweaks [optional]
- Watchdog [optional]
- Disable HDMI to conserve power [optional]
- Configure Bluetooth Low Energy tethering [optional]

__Usage:__

 1. open console on your raspi eg `ssh ubuntu@192.168.10.4` (you still remember the password you set before?) and run ns-local-install script for an interactive install:
    ```
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve8x8/deploy-ns-local-raspi/arm64-ubuntu-bionic/ns-local-install.sh | bash -
    ```
	answer a few questions, then
	relax and drink some :coffee: - script runtime *about 30 minutes on a raspi 3*.
	
	You can also use a non-interactive install:
    ```
    mkdir -p ns
    cd ns
    git clone https://github.com/steve8x8/deploy-ns-local-raspi.git
    cd deploy-ns-local-raspi
    git checkout arm64-ubuntu-bionic
    ```
	You can then use 
    ```
    bash ns-local-install.sh [--mongo=[yes|no]] [--units=[mmol|mg]] [--storage=[openaps|mongodb]] [--oref0=[yes|no]] [--units=[mmol|mg]]
    ```
	For example: 
    ```
    bash ns-local-install.sh --mongo=yes --units=mmol --storage=mongo --oref0=yes
    ```

 2. after running the script you will have a running nightscout local installation. Now open editor with your config for nightscout.
    `nano /home/ubuntu/ns/start-nightscout.sh`
    You need to configure at least the lines at the top of the file:
    ```
    CUSTOM_TITLE=mysitename_without_spaces
    API_SECRET=my_12_characters_or_more_password
    ```
    Put your personal password (at least 12 characters long) and the name of your site (just for display) there!
 
 3. once finished, restart nightscout with: `sudo /etc/init.d/nightscout stop && sudo /etc/init.d/nightscout start`
 4. navigate to http://192.168.10.4:1337/ complete nightscout profile settings
 5. Have fun :smiley:

__Troubleshooting:__

 * nodejs manual start: `ubuntu@raspberrypi:~/ns/cgm-remote-monitor $ ../start-nightscout.sh` (must be in cgm-remote-monitor directory)
 * nodejs / nightscout log: check `cat /var/log/nightscout.log` 
 * mongodb: check `cat /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log` should contain: `[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017`

__Changelog:__

2020-03-03:

- adopted by steve8x8, for use with RasPi 3B and up, running 64-bit Ubuntu Bionic
- use Node from APT, Mongo from mongodb.org
- ToDo: check whether n is required at all; use/convert my.env

2016-11-13:

- upgrade nightscout to 0.9.1-dev-20161112, in order to support openaps-storage, see https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/pull/2114

2016-10-14: 

- change to nightscout 0.9.0 stable (Grilled Cheese)
- add start_nightscout.sh instead of my.env

2016-09:
~~I forked the current dev-branch of nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor and changed the mongodb compatibility problems. Now it runs smoothly with mongodb 2.x on a raspi!
Maybe the pull request gets accepted soon. As soon as IÂ´m notified, I will change the script again to use the current dev-branch again.~~
The patches for mongo2.x compatibility are now merged back into the official dev branch.
